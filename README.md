## Netflix OSS on with Eureka Server

This project demonstrates the use of Netflix OSS with Spring Cloud on any cloud Heroku. It defines a Eureka server
that can be used for service discovery. Once this project is up and running, you can connect the 
[Eureka client template](https://github.com/kissaten/template-eureka-client) to it.

## Quickstart

Once it's deployed, Eureka will prompt you for credentials. The defaults are `user` and `password`.
